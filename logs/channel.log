[1;33mKaimana barters:[0;37m I'm going to sell my awesome sword soon, I just wish that more players would use auction that were low/mid level, it seems like most of the stuff there is either in the LVL 181/201 range, or low level stuff that isn't that great but people who don't know think it is[0;37m
[1;33mCytan barters:[0;37m have a serious seller, who had a serious buyer.  hallowed light discussion over.  lets go to skinners SH skins.  or whatever it is.[0;37m
[1;33mKaimana barters:[0;37m I'm worried no one will buy it, like before, and the auction system on this game keeps it, which I hate[0;37m
[1;33mKaimana barters:[0;37m but I know that it's amazing how many times I've been able to sharpen it and how good it is for it's level[0;37m
[1;33mTiklmelmo barters:[0;37m you can bid on it yourself to avoid that[0;37m
[1;33mGoal Bot Xochitl barters:[0;37m You can place a bid on your own item so it won't be retained.[0;37m

[1;33mKaimana barters:[0;37m this one is LVL97, 165 damage, 4DEX 4STR 10 DAM 6Hit and vampiric, which is pretty awesome, and the aard swords I think are vorpal, but not vampiric, which I find to be more useful in the long run anyway[0;37m

[1;36mHuge Wang Dexx gossips 'In honor of the hardest working immortal on AARD - for the next five T0-T2s who come to 2se (of recall), five free item/weapon/armor enchants.  I will cast resonate, solidify,  and illuminate on the object.  I can also cast enchant armor up to 3 times (upon request, but this raises level of item by one lever per casting unless it is already level 200 or above.  This carries risk of destroying the item).  I will not reimburse for enchant armor - request it at own risk.  Note - if item has Hum, Invis, Glow flags set, I can not enchant further (this is default setting on AARD equipment).  Ivar's Item Remodeling (run 2s4wn from recall) offers the service to flip the flags for a cost of 2 tps.  Be sure to "read sign" at the shop to understand how to use the service.  Do this at your own risk (I will not reimburse TPs).  If item is "solidified, resonated, illuminated" already, I can not enchant it - apparently someone else has done so already.'[0;37m
[1;33mKaimana barters:[0;37m yeah, OP for the level isn't my style, and I know that as you go up it'll become less so, but for about 20 levels though you'll be a god, and then after that a ways you'll suck until you quest a bunch of times again[0;37m
